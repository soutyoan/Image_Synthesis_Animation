## Creating multiple targets with qmake

We are currently using multiple target for test purposes.  
- To change target :
 - Clean the folder by using the clean.sh file
 - Choose your target from one of the current available targets.
   Current targets are :
    1. myViewer (global)
    2. parser (parser test)
    3. tests (tests unitaires)

    Execute : qmake CONFIG+=target
